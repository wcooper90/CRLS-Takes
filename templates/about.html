      CRLS Takes is an attempt by a CRLS student to replace the sports section of
      Register Forum (the high school newspaper). This blogsite will include a variety of fucntions
      which will make it easier for students to share opinions and articles on everything
      sports-related, both within the school and for other sports organizations.

      For the time being, many of the links you see do not do anything. In the future,
      we'd like for there to be two main functions for CRLS Takes -- Takes and Blogs.
      Blogs are your typical opinionated/unopinionated articles, whereas Takes are only a
      sentence or two. Once we have a dynamic website which allows users to register for accounts
      and to write Takes and Blogs, users can vote on Takes (five options: Freezing Cold, Cool,
      Lukewarm, Hot, and Scalding). The Takes can be found through the dropdown menu in the
      navigation bar, and each take can have a comment section and a link to a connected Blog.
    </p>

      Hopefully that wasn't too difficult to follow. If it was, hopefully future updates to
      website will clear things up.
